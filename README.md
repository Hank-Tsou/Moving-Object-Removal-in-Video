#### Abstract
<pre>  Today, removing objects in photos is very common. However, image processing not only includes pictures and</br>photos but also videos. People produce a variety of videos every day, and therefore, video processing becomes</br>very important, whether it pertains to TV shows, movies, or even records of daily life. This project attempts</br>to separate and remove moving objects from video, and is based on Kalman filtering, background subtraction,</br>and image inpainting. This project presents another method to inpaint the frame image during the process.</br></br>  In the paper which I implement [1], they use exemplar-based texture synthesis for image completion [4]. I</br> present another method that uses texture synthesis to repair the image by considering image information from</br>other frames.</br>
Keywords: video processing, object removal, image inpainting, background subtraction, kalman filter, texture</br>synthesis,temporality image.
