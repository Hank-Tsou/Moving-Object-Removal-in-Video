#### Abstract
><pre>  Today, removing objects in photos is very common. However, image processing not only includes pictures </br>and photos but also videos. People produce a variety of videos every day, and therefore, video processing</br>becomes very important, whether it pertains to TV shows, movies, or even records of daily life. This project</br>attempts to separate and remove moving objects from video, and is based on Kalman filtering, background</br>subtraction, and image inpainting. This project presents another method to inpaint the frame image during the process.</br></br>  In the paper which I implement [1], they use exemplar-based texture synthesis for image completion [4]. I</br> present another method that uses texture synthesis to repair the image by considering image information from</br>other frames.</br>
Keywords: video processing, object removal, image inpainting, background subtraction, kalman filter, texture</br>synthesis,temporality image. </br>
